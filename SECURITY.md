## Reporting a Vulnerability

<!-- Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.-->
Although there really shouldn't be any; you can report any vulnerabilities  to me by sending an email to tundachico@gmail.com 
I'll try to respond as soon as I can but it might take upwards of a month. I'll email you back wheather it's going to be fixed or not.
 If you want to try fixing it yourself please go ahead.
<!-- Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
## reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
## declined, etc.-->
